Analytic FORK is a analytical tool initially designed to analyse energy and water consumption figure of manufacturing industries and similar companies at each stage of manufacturing and forcast the values for the same.But FORCK have alot more potential so after some modification FORCK is ready to analyize and do forcasting on any entered data (in the required format). At the present time FORK is using LSTM as its forcasting model. To get the required format please click on format in support section.


## LSTM

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture that addresses the limitations of traditional RNNs in handling long-range dependencies and vanishing gradient problems. LSTMs are designed to capture and retain information over extended sequences, making them particularly useful for tasks involving sequential data like natural language processing, speech recognition, and time series analysis. What sets LSTMs apart is their ability to selectively forget or remember information through a set of specialized gating mechanisms ‚Äì the input gate, forget gate, and output gate. These gates control the flow of information within the LSTM unit, allowing it to store relevant information over long periods while preventing the degradation of gradient signals during training. This unique architecture has made LSTMs a cornerstone in the development of advanced machine learning models for tasks requiring an understanding of context and temporal dependencies.
